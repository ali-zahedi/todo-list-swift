# todo-list-swift
A Simple To Do List app built using Swift for the iPhone

This is a Tabbed Application using which a user can:
- add todo items
- list all todo items
- delete a todo item

All todo items are persistently stored via ```NSUserDefaults```

I have not focused on design, since building this is part of a learning exercise.
